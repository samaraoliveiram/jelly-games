### How to play
- Create a new game and send the game link to your friends.

    - **Players** are split into equal **teams**
    - Each **player** writes down 3 **words**
    - After everyone submits their **words**, the first round begins
- The **game** has 3 **rounds**
- In each round, a **player** receives a **word** and their **team** has to guess it within a turn
- Each **turn** lasts for 1 minute
- Each correct guess is worth 1 **point**
- When a **turn** ends, the next **team** plays
- A **round** ends when all the **words** are guessed.
- Each **round** has a theme:
    1. *password*: give as many tips as needed!
    2. *mimicry*: give tips by mimicking!
    3. *one*-*password*: give only one tip!
- The **winner** of the game is the team with the most **points**
